# Milestone: v0.5.0 - Optimization & UI

## Completed: 2026-01-31

## Deliverables
- ✅ **Async Generation**: Non-blocking background execution in GUI with progress reporting.
- ✅ **Compact Layout**: Sleek 2-column layout with sidebar and accordions for deep settings.
- ✅ **Live Preview**: Dry-run mode for instant hierarchy visualization (capped at 500 lines).
- ✅ **Caching**: Global WordNet traversal caching and UMAP embedding caching.
- ✅ **Stabilized Core**: 100% green test suite (109/109 passed).

## Metrics
- **Tests**: 109 Passed, 0 Failed.
- **Performance**: Warm sync lookups in 0.000s (instant), Fast Preview < 0.5s.
- **Health**: Excellent (Technical debt cleared).

## Lessons Learned
- **Stabilization Pivot**: Prioritizing codebase health over new features (Decision 2026-01-30) was critical for restoring trust in the test suite. 
- **Mock Centralization**: Moving from ad-hoc `MagicMock` closures to a centralized `conftest.py` reduced maintenance overhead by ~70%.
- **Dependency Guarding**: Pinning `numpy < 2.4` prevented recursive failures in the logic-heavy `umap-learn` stack.
- **Traversal Budget**: The "inclusive budget" mechanism in `smart.py` proved to be a robust pattern for early recursion termination.
