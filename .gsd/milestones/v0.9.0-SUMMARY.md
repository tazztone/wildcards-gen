# Milestone Summary: v0.9.0 - Performance & Expansion

## Accomplishments
- **Batch Processing**: Implemented `BatchProcessor` in `wildcards_gen/batch.py` supporting YAML manifests and parameter matrices.
- **Interoperability**: Added JSONL export format for ML training pipelines.
- **Instruction Templates**: Standardized comment generation using customizable templates in `config.py` and across all dataset modules.
- **Stability Fixes**: Resolved critical "Explosion" (duplication) and "Data Loss" issues in the Arranger logic.
- **Verification**: Built a comprehensive test suite including `test_batch_integration.py` and `test_tencent_dataloss.py`.

## Metrics
- **Performance**: Batch jobs now run in parallel using `ProcessPoolExecutor`, bypassing the GIL.
- **Reliability**: 100% pass rate on new deep integration and signature synchronization tests.

## Lessons Learned
- **Recursion Depth**: Aggressive smart pruning needs careful budget management to avoid "disappearing" categories at low depth limits.
- **Data Integrity**: Flattening operations must be audited for "orphaned" children to prevent data loss.

## Status: ARCHIVED
This milestone is successfully completed and verified.
