# ROADMAP.md

> **Current Milestone**: v0.5.0 - Optimization & UI
> **Goal**: Polish the user experience and optimize performance now that the core engine is robust.

## Must-Haves
- [ ] **Async Generation**: Move long-running tasks to background threads to keep GUI responsive.
- [ ] **Compact Layout**: Optimizing `gui.py` use of vertical space (Collapsibles, Sidebar).
- [ ] **Live Preview**: "Preview" button in Builder tab to show first 50 lines of structure instantly.
- [ ] **Caching**: Aggressive caching for Synset lookups to speed up re-runs.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Async UI Foundation
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Refactor the centralized `cli.py`/`gui.py` invocation to support non-blocking execution (threaded/asyncio) and progress reporting.

### Phase 2: UI Refresh & Feature Exposure
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Reorganize the Gradio layout for compactness and expose all deep engine parameters (Smart/Arranger settings) to the user.


### Phase 3: Fast Preview Engine
**Status**: 🚧 Partial
**Objective**: Implement a "Dry Run" pipeline that skips heavy clustering/shaping to just show the raw pruned structure instantly.

### Phase 4: Gap Closure & Verification
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Address missed optimizations (WordNet caching) and strictly verify performance claims.

**Gaps to Close:**
- [ ] **WordNet Caching**: Cache expensive graph traversals (`get_all_descendants`).
- [ ] **Performance Verification**: Benchmark "Deep Tuning" latency.
