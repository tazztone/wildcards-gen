# Plan 3.1 Summary: UMAP Caching Logic

## Accomplished
- **Implemented Caching**: Added `_UMAP_CACHE` to `wildcards_gen/core/arranger.py`.
- **Implemented Hashing**: Added `_hash_array` for stable numpy array hashing.
- **Dependency Fix**: Locked `numpy<2.4` to resolve `numba`/`umap-learn` conflict.
- **Verification**: Created `tests/test_arranger_caching.py` covering consistency, caching behavior (hits), and eviction.

## Verification Results
- `pytest tests/test_arranger_caching.py`: **PASSED** (3 passed).
- Confirmed `UMAP` import works (`UMAP OK`).

## Next Steps
- proceed to verify GUI responsiveness or further optimizations.
