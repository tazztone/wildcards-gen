# State - Milestone v0.8.0 [PLANNING]

## Current Position
- **Phase**: 4
- **Task**: Planning complete
- **Status**: Ready for execution

## Last Session Summary
Milestone v0.8.0 was briefly completed, but a new bug was discovered in `arranger.py` related to `return_metadata` parameter collision. Testing was deemed "not good enough" by the user.

## Next Steps
1. `/plan 4` — Create plans to fix the deep-stack crash and harden tests.
