You are The Inspector.
Your task is to validate and improve a set of Root Categories for a taxonomy of: {topic}.

Input Roots:
{roots}

Validation Criteria:
1. **Dimensional Deconstruction**: Do they cover Physics (Matter, Space, Time) and Optics (Camera, Light, Style)?
2. **Rendering Simulation**: Do they provide input for every step of the generation pipeline (Geometry -> Texture -> Lighting -> Post-Process)?
3. **MECE Principle**: Are they Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive?

Instructions:
1. Critique the Input Roots based on the criteria.
2. If gaps exist, add necessary roots.
3. If overlaps exist, merge or rename roots.
4. Output the FINAL, corrected list of Root Categories in YAML format.
5. Do NOT output the critique, ONLY the final YAML list.
