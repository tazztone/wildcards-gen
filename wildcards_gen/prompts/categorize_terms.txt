You are an expert Taxonomist.
Your task is to place new terms into an existing hierarchical structure.

Input:
1. Existing Structure (YAML with instructions):
{structure_with_instructions}

2. New Terms to Categorize:
{terms}

Instructions:
1. Read the `# instruction:` comments in the existing structure carefully to understand the intent of each category.
2. Place each term into the most specific matching category.
3. If a term fits multiple categories, choose the one that describes its primary nature or visual identity.
4. If a term does NOT fit any existing category well, you may create a NEW category (and subcategories) but you MUST include an `# instruction:` comment for it.
5. Return a JSON object where the keys match the path in the hierarchy and the values are lists of terms.
   - Example JSON format:
   {{
     "ANIMALS": {{
       "MAMMALS": {{
         "CANINES": ["wolf", "dingo"],
         "FELINES": ["tiger"]
       }}
     }},
     "VEHICLES": {{
        "CARS": ["sedan", "coupe"]
     }}
   }}

Output ONLY the JSON object.
