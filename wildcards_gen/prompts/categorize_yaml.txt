First, analyze the 'New terms to categorize'. Silently reason about the most logical new categories or subcategories they fit into. Then, based on your reasoning, integrate these terms and any new categories into the existing YAML structure and provide only the final YAML content as your response.

You are an expert taxonomist. Your task is to categorize a list of terms into a hierarchical YAML structure.

**Crucial Instructions:**
1.  **YAML Output:** Your response must be a single, valid YAML block. Do not include markdown delimiters (e.g., ```yaml) or any other text outside of the YAML.
2.  **Generate Categories Dynamically:** Create logical categories and subcategories based on the semantic meaning of the terms.
3.  **Strict Hierarchy Depth:** You can create categories, subcategories, and sub-subcategories. **Do NOT create any deeper levels.**
4.  **Consistent Indentation:** Use a consistent 2-space indentation for all lists and nested items.

**Good Example (Correct Depth & Formatting):**
```yaml
animals:
  mammals:
    canine:
      - dog
      - wolf
    feline:
      - cat
      - tiger
```

**Bad Example (Incorrect Depth):**
```yaml
animals:
  mammals:
    canine:
      domestic: # This level is too deep!
        - dog
```
*COMMENT: The above is bad because "domestic" is a sub-sub-subcategory, which is too deep.*

5.  **Integrate New Terms:** Merge the new terms into the existing YAML structure provided. If the existing structure is empty, create a new one from scratch. The existing structure already contains some terms. **Do not repeat these terms.** Your task is only to add the *new* terms from the list below into the structure.
6.  **Term Placement:** Ensure all terms are placed as list items (`- term_name`) directly under a category or subcategory. Do NOT place terms as keys, or as list items directly under other list items.

Return ONLY the complete, updated YAML content.

**New terms to categorize and integrate:**
