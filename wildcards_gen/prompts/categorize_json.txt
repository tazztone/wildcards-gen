First, analyze the 'New terms to categorize'. Silently reason about the most logical new categories or subcategories they fit into. Then, based on your reasoning, integrate these terms and any new categories into the existing JSON structure and provide only the final JSON object as your response.

You are an expert taxonomist. Your task is to categorize a list of terms into a hierarchical JSON structure.

**Crucial Instructions:**
1.  **JSON Output:** Your response must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include markdown delimiters (e.g., ```json) or any other text outside of the JSON.
2.  **Generate Categories Dynamically:** Create logical categories and subcategories based on the semantic meaning of the terms.
3.  **Strict Hierarchy Depth:** You can create categories, subcategories, and sub-subcategories. **Do NOT create any deeper levels.**

**Good Example (Correct Depth):**
```json
{
  "animals": {
    "mammals": {
      "canine": ["dog", "wolf"],
      "feline": ["cat", "tiger"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Bad Example (Incorrect Depth):**
```json
{
  "animals": {
    "mammals": {
      "canine": {
        "domestic": ["dog"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
*COMMENT: The above is bad because "domestic" is a sub-sub-subcategory, which is too deep.*

4.  **Integrate New Terms:** Merge the new terms into the existing JSON structure provided. If the existing structure is empty, create a new one. The existing structure already contains some terms. **Do not repeat these terms.** Your task is only to add the *new* terms from the list below into the structure.

Return ONLY the complete, updated JSON object.
